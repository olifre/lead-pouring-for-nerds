# Lead-pouring for Nerds

This notebook makes use of the randomness of Qubits to generate random images. 

Similar to the tradition of lead pouring at New Year's, you may try to identify shapes in these generated pictures. 

It makes use of [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) and can be run on the [IBM Quantum Experience](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com) to get access to real quantum computers. 

Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with IBM. I hope this project will be a simple example to motivate users to make scientific use of these systems.
